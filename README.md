### Features

- Classic Checkers Rules: Two-player game supporting alternating turns and standard checkers moves.
- Multiple Capture Moves: Detect and allow multiple captures when possible, with visual feedback.
- Move Highlights: Display available moves and captures with visual cues on the game board.
- King Promotion: When a piece reaches the opponentâ€™s last row, it is promoted to a King and can move both forward and backward.
- Dynamic Board Rendering: The game board and pieces update dynamically based on the current state.
- Responsive Design: Scales well across different screen sizes.

### Technologies

- Svelte: A lightweight JavaScript framework for building UI.
- TypeScript: For static type-checking and better development experience.
- Vite: Fast build tool used for development and bundling the app.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

### Installation

To get started with the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/tasplo/checkers-game-in-svelte.git>
cd checkers-game
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

The application should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>.

### How to Play

1. Start the game: Load the application in your browser. The checkers board will render with pieces positioned at their starting points.
2. Make a move: Click on a piece to view its available moves. Legal moves will be highlighted with an indicator.
3. Capture moves: If a piece can make a capture, the possible capture squares will be highlighted. Click on a highlighted square to perform the capture.
4. King Promotion: When a piece reaches the last row on the opponentâ€™s side, it is promoted to a King. Kings can move both forward and backward.
5. Winning: The game continues until one player has no pieces or moves left, signaling the end of the game.

### Game Logic

The game logic is handled in the game.ts file within the Svelte Store. This includes:

- Move generation: Both normal and capture moves are generated based on the current board state.
- King promotion: Pieces reaching the far end of the board are promoted to Kings.
- Capture logic: If a piece can capture an opponentâ€™s piece, it highlights all available capture paths, including chained captures.
- Turn management: The game alternates turns between players and handles player input accordingly.

#### Example: Move and Capture Logic

Hereâ€™s an overview of how the logic works for detecting capture moves:

```typescript
$: if (must_capture && selected.length) {
  captureMoves = [];

  captures.forEach((capture) => {
    if (capture.start.toString() === selected.toString()) {
      captureMoves.push(capture.end);
    }
    captureMoves.forEach((_move) => {
      if (_move.toString() === capture.start.toString()) {
        captureMoves.push(capture.end);
      }
    });
  });
}
```

This ensures that multi-capture moves are correctly tracked and displayed.
